# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel pretty good about it. It makes sense!
# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- Yes, always!! I want to learn more methods, see arrays in action, and also I'd like to understand the reason and importance of why an item gets removed and then returned to me in something like a .pop
# What questions do you have about Arrays?
- If arrays are a means for humans to quantify objects into manageable groups, what are some other ways coding can make life more understandable? Can learning to code change the way I see everything in my life?
